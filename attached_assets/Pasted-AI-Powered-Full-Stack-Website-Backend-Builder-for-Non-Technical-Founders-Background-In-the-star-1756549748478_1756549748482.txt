AI-Powered Full-Stack Website & Backend Builder for
Non-Technical Founders
Background
In the startup world, countless early-stage founders and entrepreneurs have brilliant ideas
but struggle to build and launch their products due to a lack of technical knowledge. Current
no-code tools like Framer or Webflow allow drag-and-drop designs but do not provide full
ownership of frontend and backend code. On the other hand, AI code generators like v0 and
Bold lack a visual canvas or do not support end-to-end functionality for real deployment.
There is a growing need for a platform that lets users design visually, generate real code,
build backend logic, and deploy the full project, all with the power of AI.
The Challenge
Build a prototype of a platform that enables non-technical users to create and deploy
full-stack web applications using drag-and-drop tools combined with AI-assisted code
generation.
The platform should allow users to:
● Design the frontend visually using a canvas or block system.
● Automatically generate production-ready code (HTML/CSS/JS or React).
● Generate backend APIs, database models, and authentication flows using AI.
● Preview, edit, and deploy the full application — frontend, backend, and database —
with minimal effort.
● Optionally integrate features like AI chat assistant, role management, test generation,
and component upload.
Your Objective
As a team, you are tasked with building an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of this platform.
The solution should focus on simplicity, usability, and real functionality — especially for
people with zero coding knowledge.
Bonus Features to Explore (Optional but Impressive)
● AI chat assistant to help with edits.
● Database schema visualizer and backend logic builder.
● One-click deployment using platforms like Vercel, Render, or Supabase.
● Ability to upload code snippets and convert them into visual components.
